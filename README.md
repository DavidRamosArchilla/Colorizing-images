## Overview

This project applies conditional adversarial networks to colorize grayscale images. The model learns to translate grayscale images into colorful ones by training on paired datasets.

## Features

- Implemented in PyTorch
- Supports custom datasets
- Includes a training script and a jupyter notebook on google colab to test a trained model hosted on huggingface model hub.
- Data augmentation and preprocessing
- Logging to tensorboard

## Training details
It has been trained with 12000 images from [COCO 2017 dataset](https://cocodataset.org/) during 150 epochs with batch size 16 and learning rate 2e-4 for both generator and discriminator. Data augmentation is done by randomly flipping horizontally the images. 

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/colorizing_images.git
cd colorizing_images
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training

```bash
python train.py
```

## Results

Here are some examples of colorized images, the upper row are the generations of the model:
